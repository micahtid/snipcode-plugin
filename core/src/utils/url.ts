/**
 * utils/url.ts: absolutize a possibly-relative url.
 *
 * This is not part of the pipeline. It is a cross-cutting utility.
 *
 * Why this exists: several extractors, such as assistive/assets, inspect/assets, and
 * inspect/colors, need to turn a page-relative url into an absolute one against the document
 * base. This was duplicated, so it lives here once, which lets both the element-scoped and
 * page-scoped extractors resolve urls identically.
 */

 * Resolves a possibly-relative url against a base. Returns '' when the url cannot be parsed,
 * so the caller drops it. It passes `data:` urls through unchanged because they are already
 * self-contained.
 *
 * @param url - the raw url, possibly relative
 * @param base - the document base to resolve against, e.g. document.baseURI || location.href
