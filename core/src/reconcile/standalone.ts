/**
 * reconcile/standalone.ts: standalone-context reconciliation + completeness probe
 *
 * Pipeline position: reconcile, the closing step, after bake + features + denoise
 * Reads from Captured: root, clone, bakedStyles, page.viewport
 * Writes to Captured: bakedStyles + clone in fix mode, warnings
 *
 * It exists because bake.ts validates each authored value by forcing it onto the
 * LIVE element and re-reading getComputedStyle. That live-context test passes for
 * values that only resolve because the page is present (a `var(--token)` defined on
 * :root, an inherited body font, an ancestor-relative length). Those values then
 * dangle once the snip is pasted standalone. The artifact's own render is the only
 * authority on what survives, so this module makes that render the source of truth.
 * It mounts the baked clone in an isolated iframe that carries only the ua stylesheet,
 * with no page author rules, exactly the pasted-snip environment. Per element, it
 * compares the clone's standalone computed style against the original's live computed
 * style. Where they diverge, the standalone artifact is wrong, so the original's
 * resolved value is baked, overriding any authored value that does not reproduce
 * standalone. One anchor fixes missing backgrounds, dangling tokens, lost display,
 * and collapsed box geometry at once, because they are all the same defect: a value
 * that only resolved while the page was present.
 *
 * Box geometry is reconciled directionally, because the standalone render is the
 * authority on size in only one direction. A non-replaced box that loses a sizing
 * input it drew from outside the snip, such as a flex track, a `var()` chain on a theme
 * ancestor, or an inset, can only collapse standalone, never grow, so its used size is
 * reclaimed only when it shrank. A box the same or larger standalone has the room its
 * content needs and is left alone, which is what keeps a font-grown fallback box from
 * being clipped back to the live width. A replaced element has an intrinsic box, so a
 * divergence in either direction is a lost size and is reclaimed. The discriminator is
 * a CSS category, replaced versus not, and the sign of the divergence, never a tolerance
 * constant. See shouldReclaim.
 *
 * The same anchor extends to structure: an element rendered in the original but
 * absent from the clone, silently dropped by some earlier handler, is restored, so a
 * dropped element is corrected universally rather than by special-casing the handler
 * that dropped it.
 *
 * Report mode (probeStandalone) runs the diff without mutating, returning the exact
 * counts of dropped properties and elements. It is deterministic and drift-free, with no
 * live screenshot, so it is the trustworthy completeness signal the measurement loop
 * gates on before trusting SSIM.

 * for a reason the directional rule cannot improve on:
 *
 * - Margins: a margin positions a box against siblings that did not travel with the
 *   snip, so its standalone value is benign. The root's are zeroed separately
 *   (zeroRootMargin), and a descendant's re-derive from the recovered box.
 * - min/max sizes: the reconciliation pins the *used* size directly, as SIZE_PROPS lists,
 *   which already overrides whatever bound produced it, so comparing the bound itself
 *   would be redundant.
 * - Geometry-derived and non-visual props: transform/perspective origins resolve from
 *   the box, and -webkit-locale is an input-method hint with no paint effect.
 * - Transition longhands: a transition describes the motion between two states and produces
 *   no pixels at rest, so the resting-render authority cannot judge it and must not reclaim
 *   it. Reconciling it toward the live value would collapse a cycled timing sub-list back to
 *   its single literal against a multi-entry transition-property, undoing the lossless
 *   expansion resolve/transition.ts makes for the emitted shorthand.
 *
 * Used size (width/height + logical) and insets (top/right/bottom/left + logical) are
 * deliberately NOT here. They are compared for every element and reclaimed through
 * shouldReclaim, which decides direction from the replaced/non-replaced CSS category.
 *
 * Custom properties are handled separately, since they never enumerate in computed style.
 * Everything else is compared. The standalone render is the authority, so any
 * divergence in a paint or box property is a real defect to correct.

 *   diverges and carries the value down, and every `currentColor`-derived property

 *   nested under dark text would keep the ancestor's dark fill and paint dark. `color` itself
 *   is never caught by this, so the load-bearing divergence still reclaims.
 * - A non-replaced element's used size is reclaimed only when it is a *confirmed*
 *   collapse, meaning artifact < target with both numeric. A box that lost an externally-imposed
 *   sizing input can only shrink standalone, while a box the same or larger has the room

 * - A replaced element's used size is reclaimed in *either* direction: its box is
