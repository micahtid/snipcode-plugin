/**
 * features/layers.ts: @layer / @property / @scope
 *
 * Pipeline position: reconcile
 * Reads from Captured: clone, bakedStyles, variables, and the synthesized <style> for
 *   used custom props. The @property scan itself lives in reconcile/properties.ts
 * Writes to Captured: clone, appending an @property <style>, and warnings
 *
 * A feature handler for the cascade-layering and registered-property mechanisms.
 *
 * CSS/spec reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@property
 * Detection criterion: a registered @property in the document whose name is a
 * custom property the snip uses. Otherwise it early-returns when none match.
 * Transform contract: it appends a <style> of the matching @property rules to the
 * clone. It reads document.styleSheets, the in-memory cssom. It touches the clone
 * only.
 *
 * Why this exists: @layer order and @scope are already resolved into the baked
 * inline styles. match.ts builds the cascade, and bake.ts's probe validates every
 * value against the computed result, which the browser produced with layer and
 * scope precedence applied. So they need no separate handling. @property is the part
 * that does not survive. A registered custom property carries a syntax, inherits
 * flag, and initial-value that govern how it falls back and interpolates, for
 * example an animated --angle gradient. Re-emitting the @property registration keeps
 * that behavior. Only the syntax registration is re-emitted, not a synthetic layer
 * order.
