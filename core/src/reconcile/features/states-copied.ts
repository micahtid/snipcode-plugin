/**
 * features/states-copied.ts: reproducing states by copying the page's authored rules
 *
 * Pipeline position: reconcile, the fallback half of features/states.ts
 * Reads from Captured: root, clone, foundationRules, componentRules, bakedStyles
 * Writes to Captured: clone, marking elements and appending state rules, and warnings
 *
 * Why this exists: this runs only when live measurement did not, so there are no measured
 * values to trust and the effect has to be inferred from the selectors themselves. Each
 * state rule is parsed, each branch bound to concrete subtree elements, the cascade resolved
 * by hand across the matching rules, and the result re-anchored to markers. That reproduces
 * the common case of an element's own `:hover` and the plain descendant and sibling
 * relations, but it cannot follow a relationship a framework buries in `:is()` or group-hover
 * grammar, and it cannot reach a trigger outside the snipped subtree. Both of those are
 * dropped with a warning rather than guessed at.
