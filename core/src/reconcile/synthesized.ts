 * reconcile/synthesized.ts: the shared synthesized-<style> carrier
 *
 * Pipeline position: reconcile, a shared helper for the feature handlers
 * Reads from Captured: clone, warnings
 * Writes to Captured: clone, one appended <style>, and warnings
 *
 * It exists because two feature handlers express what an inline style cannot, and so
 * both ship a real css rule rather than a property. pseudo.ts materializes
 * ::before/::marker content, and states.ts reproduces :hover/:focus/:active. Each
 * needs the identical plumbing: a marker re-anchored rule appended to a <style> on
 * the clone, later lifted into the document head by convert/format.ts. Rather than
 * have each handler create and manage its own <style> (the v1-era copy-paste), they
 * share one carrier here. A single appended <style> collects every synthesized rule,
 * which also gives the resolve phase one place to find and rewrite those rules'
 * url()/var() references (see resolve/inline.ts and resolve/vars.ts).
 *
 * The carrier is tagged with a data-* attribute so the resolve passes can locate it
 * and convert/format.ts strips it on lift. It never reaches the emitted markup.
