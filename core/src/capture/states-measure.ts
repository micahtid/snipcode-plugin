/**
 * capture/states-measure.ts: measure interactive states by forcing them live
 *
 * Pipeline position: capture
 * Reads from Captured: root, foundationRules, componentRules
 * Writes to Captured: measuredStates, warnings
 *
 * Why this exists: the rest of the pipeline establishes fidelity by measuring ground
 * truth: bake.ts renders the live element and trusts an authored value only when it
 * round-trips. Interactive states were the one corner that guessed instead: the reconcile
 * handler copied authored `:hover`/`:focus`/`:active` rules and replayed them, which fails
 * two ways on real components. It silently drops descendant effects a framework encodes
 * out of reach: Tailwind's `group-hover:` compiles to `:is(:where(.group):hover *)`, whose
 * `:hover` is buried inside `:is()`. And it replays a parent rule that rides on an
 * inheritance the resting bake already flattened: a hovered pill turns its text white via
 * inheritance, but the bake froze an explicit per-element color that outranks it.
 *
 * This module restores the measure-don't-copy principle to states. It forces each state in
 * the live browser and reads what actually computes on the trigger and the elements a single
 * combinator can re-anchor to it, its descendants and following siblings, so the engine
 * resolves group-hover, descendant, sibling, and inherited effects for free, with no
 * selector-grammar decoding. The values it records are concrete, already cascade- and
 * inheritance-resolved literals, so the reconcile emit (features/states.ts) is a pure transform
 * with no var() survival or per-property cascade merge left to do.
 *
 * Each scoped element is read on two layers: its own box, and any ::before/::after that
 * generates a box at rest. This covers the common hover idiom of a glow/underline/reveal that
 * lives entirely on a generated box, whose own element style never changes. A pseudo layer is
 * diffed against its own resting baseline and emitted as its own affected entry, so reconcile
 * can re-anchor it as `[marker]:hover::after { ... }` over the resting pseudo the pseudo pass
 * already ships.
 *
 * The forcing is privileged and lives here, beside capture/cdp.ts's other CDP paths, for the
 * same reason: only the background can attach the debugger, since chrome.debugger is
 * background-only, and only the live capture phase has the element, its ancestor chain, and
 * getComputedStyle. It soft-fails exactly like the inherited-chain capture: if the debugger
 * is busy, such as when devtools is open, the snip proceeds and reconcile falls back to copying rules.
 *
 * Determinism: forced values are read under a temporary transitions-off/animations-off shim,
 * so every endpoint is the state's final value read instantaneously, with no mid-transition
 * sampling, no settle-timing flakiness. The page is left exactly as found, with states cleared,
 * shim removed, and tags removed, even on error.
