/**
 * capture/cdp.ts: privileged capture augmentation (inherited chain and cross-origin sheets)
 *
 * Pipeline position: capture
 * Reads from Captured: root, element.selector, inaccessible.crossOriginStylesheets
 * Writes to Captured: foundationRules from cdp inherited rules, componentRules,
 * variables, fonts, keyframes recovered cross-origin, inaccessible
 *
 * Feeds the inheritance bake. The cdp inherited chain is the authored ancestor
 * cascade that bake.ts later bakes onto the snip root.
 *
 * Why this exists: two things the content script cannot do alone. First, it reads
 * the *authored* ancestor cascade, the devtools "inherited from" section. Only the
 * chrome devtools protocol exposes it, and chrome.debugger is background-only.
 * Second, it reads cross-origin stylesheets blocked by the same-origin policy,
 * which only a background fetch with <all_urls> host permission can do. Both are
 * delegated to the background worker over capture-internal messages
 * (CDP_INHERITED / FETCH_STYLESHEET).
 *
 * The v2 change versus v1 is that DOM.getDocument runs with { pierce: true } so
 * the document tree includes closed shadow roots, letting the inherited chain
 * resolve through them. The full shadow handler lands later.

/**
 * Recovers the @font-face rules that cross-origin stylesheets hide, by reading the text
 * the browser already parsed over cdp. recoverCrossOriginSheets above tries a privileged
 * re-fetch, which a cdn waf often blocks for the extension origin. This fallback reads
 * the same sheets through the devtools protocol, which is not bound by the same-origin
 * policy and needs no network round-trip. It runs over the hrefs still flagged
 * inaccessible after the fetch attempt, so it closes exactly the font-discovery gap those
 * sites leave, when a snip's web font lives only in a cdn-hosted, unreadable, unfetchable
 * sheet.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately @font-face only. The goal is to recover fonts, a resource the
 * artifact must carry, not the full cross-origin cascade, so only the faces are
 * harvested and the inaccessible list is left untouched. parseCssText absolutizes each
 * recovered src against the sheet href, since a src is relative to its stylesheet, not the
 * page, so a relative or root-relative src on a cdn-hosted sheet resolves to the cdn
 * host rather than the wrong page origin.
