/**
 * inspect/types.ts: the contracts the page-scoped inspectors share
 *
 * Pipeline position: inspect, page-scoped. This is the shape every inspector emits, and it runs no element pipeline phase.
 * Reads from DOM: nothing. These are type definitions.
 * Writes to: nothing. These are type definitions.
 *
 * Principles applied: none. These are type definitions.
 *
 * Why this exists: each of the four inspectors, fonts, assets, colors, and schema,
 * scans the whole page and ships one result to the side panel. Defining the report
 * records and the tagged InspectResult union in one place is what lets the content
 * script, the message ship, and the panel views agree on a shape without importing
 * each other. These are the v2-named, trimmed equivalents of v1's FontInfo /
 * AssetInfo / color cluster. Only the fields a panel actually renders survive.
 * v1's extractionTime / totalElements / per-element debug lists are dropped.
