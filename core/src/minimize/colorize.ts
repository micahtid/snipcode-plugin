/**
 * minimize/colorize.ts: post-format serialization sanity for colors and saturating lengths
 *
 * Pipeline position: minimize, last, after format
 * Reads from Captured: nothing
 * Writes to Captured: nothing. It transforms the formatted stylesheet string.
 *
 * Why this exists: the reproduce phase emits colors in whatever notation the engine
 * computed them to, verbose rgb(83, 58, 253) triples and rgba(31, 35, 40, 0.04)
 * functions. A human writes #533afd and #1f232809. This phase rewrites every rgb() and
 * rgba() function to a short hex, using the canvas 2d context as the authority: setting
 * fillStyle to the color yields the engine's own canonical form, so the rewrite is the
 * same color the browser would paint, by construction, with no color math here and no
 * gamut guesswork. Wide-gamut oklab/oklch/lab/lch/color() notations are never converted, so
 * they keep their color space rather than being clamped to the srgb gamut. Their numeric
 * components are only trimmed of the float noise a computed round-trip leaves, so
 * `oklab(0.999994 0.0000455678 0.0000200868 / 0.5)` reads as `oklab(1 0 0 / 0.5)`. And a
 * border radius the engine rounded to the saturation overflow, `2.12676e+37rem`, is clamped
 * to a plain `9999px` that paints the same full pill on any real element.
 *
 * It is a pure string transform and runs last, after format, for two reasons. First, it
 * needs no render oracle. An rgb()/rgba() function and its canvas-canonical hex paint the
 * identical pixel, a trimmed color component moves the pixel by less than a 24-bit step, and
 * a border radius past the saturation point paints the identical corner, so the rewrite
 * cannot move the render, in a resting rule, a state rule, a shadow, or a gradient alike.
 * Second, a cssom round-trip re-serializes a standalone hex back to rgb() and re-inflates a
 * trimmed component, so any phase that re-parses the sheet (format among them) would undo the
 * rewrite. Operating on the already-formatted text as a plain string sidesteps that and
 * preserves the indentation format produced.
 *
 * Two boundaries keep the rewrite paint-exact rather than merely close. First, it is
 * segment-aware. Quoted strings and url() spans are matched as whole units and left untouched,
 * so an `rgba(` sequence that is text (a `content` value, an svg data uri) is never mistaken
 * for a color. Second, a color is only rewritten when the text right after it is a delimiter.
 * A function ends in `)`, but a bare hex does not, so a color packed against the next token
 * (tailwind serializes gradient stops as `rgb(25, 25, 29)0px`) would glue into one invalid
 * hash token. Such a color keeps its delimited functional form.
