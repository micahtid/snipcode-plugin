/**
 * minimize/merge.ts: merge identical rules into selector lists
 *
 * Pipeline position: minimize, after normalize and before relax
 * Reads from Captured: page.viewport via the oracle, plus warnings on graceful skip
 * Writes to Captured: nothing. It transforms the normalized stylesheet string.
 *
 * Why this exists: the reproduce phase gives every element its own generated class and
 * rule, so a grid of eight cards styled the same emits the same declaration block eight
 * times. Pruning and normalizing can also drive two rules that differed to the identical
 * body. A human writes that body once against a selector list. This phase collapses every
 * group of rules whose declaration block is now identical into one rule whose selector is
 * the comma-joined list, in document order, and drops the duplicates.
 *
 * The merged resting rule takes the position of the last rule in its group, the latest
 * cascade position the block held. Every such merge is verified by the computed-style oracle
 * over exactly the elements the group's selectors match. So a cascade change from moving a
 * block later, past some rule that overrides one of its properties, is caught, and that merge
 * is reverted while the others stand.
 *
 * The withheld state and pseudo rules are merged too, but the resting oracle is blind to
 * them, so their merge is accepted by construction under syntactic checks rather than by the
 * oracle (see mergeWithheldRules). At rules stay out of scope. The transform is deterministic,
 * groups are processed in selector order, and it only ever shrinks the stylesheet.
