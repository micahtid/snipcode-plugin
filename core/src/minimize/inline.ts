/**
 * minimize/inline.ts: inline the custom-property dumps
 *
 * Pipeline position: minimize, after the at-rule purge and before format
 * Reads from Captured: page.viewport via the oracle, plus warnings on graceful skip
 * Writes to Captured: nothing. It transforms the stylesheet string.
 *
 * Why this exists: the reproduce phase bakes a wall of custom properties (`--text-sm`,
 * `--border`, `--spacing`) onto the emitted rules and then reads them back through var(),
 * an indirection a human writing this by hand would not keep. This phase resolves each
 * `var(--x)` to the value it actually holds at that site, read from the mounted frame, and
 * then drops the custom-property declarations nothing references any more, so the sheet
 * reads as the literal values it paints.
 *
 * Two safeties bound it. The inlining is oracle-gated. Every var() a rule holds is resolved
 * over exactly the elements the rule matches, substituted only when they all agree, and the
 * whole batch is reverted if the computed-style oracle sees any render change. The deletion
 * is by construction, not oracle-gated, because getComputedStyle enumerates a custom
 * property, so removing its declaration changes that property's own computed value even
 * though nothing paints from it any more, which the oracle would wrongly veto. A name with no
 * surviving var() reference governs nothing, so dropping its declaration is render-neutral.
 *
 * A custom property is left alone, both its var() references and its declaration, when it
 * carries motion the resting frame cannot see: named inside an @keyframes, listed in a
 * transition or animation, or redefined by a state or pseudo rule. That last case matters
 * most. A resting `color: var(--x)` is dynamic, so if a :hover rule redefines `--x` the color
 * follows it on hover. Inlining the resting reference to its resting sample would freeze the
 * color and strip the state change.
