/**
 * minimize/normalize.ts: shorthand folding + human property order
 *
 * Pipeline position: minimize, after prune and before hoist
 * Reads from Captured: page.viewport via the oracle, plus warnings on graceful skip
 * Writes to Captured: nothing. It transforms the minimized stylesheet string.
 *
 * Why this exists: the pruned stylesheet still reads like a machine dump. Each rule lists
 * the longhands the reproduce phase baked, in computed-style order, so a box's four
 * margins sit apart from its four paddings and a border is spelled out as twelve
 * declarations. A human writes the shorthand and groups related properties. This phase
 * does both, in one move. It reorders each rule's declarations into a fixed human order
 * (layout, then box, then spacing, then border, then background, then type, then effects),
 * and lets the cssom fold the now-adjacent longhand families back into their shorthands as it
 * reserializes. margin-top/right/bottom/left becomes margin, the border longhands become
 * border-width/style/color, and top/right/bottom/left becomes inset.
 *
 * It is render-neutral by construction and verified anyway. Reordering distinct properties
 * cannot change the cascade, and folding a full longhand family into its shorthand sets the
 * identical values, so the render is unchanged. The computed-style oracle confirms it over
 * the whole stylesheet. If some rule's reorder did change the render, because it mixed
 * a shorthand with a longhand it overrides, the phase ships the pruned css untouched rather
 * than a wrong render. The transform is a pure string reshuffle, so it is deterministic and
 * never grows the stylesheet.
 *
 * The reorder runs on in-scope rules only, exactly as in prune (see inScopeRule). After it, a
 * second pass drops each longhand a preceding shorthand in the same block already sets to that
 * value, the restatement a machine dump leaves behind, most often a border-radius spelled out
 * again as its four corner longhands. That drop is render-neutral by CSS definition, so it
 * needs no oracle and runs on withheld state and pseudo rules too, where such restatement is
 * densest.

/**

 * declaration's rank is the index of the first prefix its property starts with, and
 * unmatched properties sort to the end, so the order is a soft grouping rather than a
 * strict per-property table. More specific prefixes precede the general one they extend,
 * so border-radius groups ahead of the border line and does not fall into it. Same-rank
 * declarations keep their original relative order, which keeps a shorthand and any longhand
 * it overrides adjacent and in sequence, so folding stays render-safe.
