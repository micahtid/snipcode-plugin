/**
 * minimize/reset.ts: inject the canonical reset preamble
 *
 * Pipeline position: minimize, after var inlining and before the closing prune rerun
 * Reads from Captured: page.viewport via the oracle, plus warnings on graceful skip
 * Writes to Captured: nothing. It transforms the stylesheet string.
 *
 * Why this exists: the reproduce phase bakes `box-sizing: border-box` onto every rule,
 * restates the inherited font on every control, and repeats the same link, list, and button
 * zeroing on element after element, because it copies each element's full computed style. A
 * human writes the lines everyone knows once, at the top, and lets the cascade carry them.
 * This injects that canonical reset, then the prune rerun that follows deletes the per-rule
 * restatements the reset now makes redundant, so `box-sizing` and `cursor: pointer` appear
 * once instead of on hundreds of rules.
 *
 * Each reset line is an addition candidate, the reverse of prune's deletion. It is inserted
 * at the top of the sheet and kept only when the computed-style oracle confirms it changed no
 * element's render. A low-specificity selector, `*` or a bare element, is overridden by any
 * real rule, so a sheet that already computes the reset value everywhere is unchanged by the
 * line and accepts it, while a deviant element keeps its own rule and vetoes nothing. A line
 * the oracle rejects is simply not injected. Because the oracle compares every computed
 * longhand, a non-painting line like `cursor: pointer` is verified exactly like a painting one,
 * and a restatement is only pruned once the preamble supplies the identical computed value.
 * Lines stay fine grained, one property to a line, because acceptance is all or nothing per
 * line. One deviant element would veto a whole coarse line and lose the rest with it.
