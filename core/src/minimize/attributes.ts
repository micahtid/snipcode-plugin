/**
 * minimize/attributes.ts: strip unreferenced data attributes from the markup
 *
 * Pipeline position: minimize, last, a markup pass after the css chain
 * Reads from Captured: nothing. It operates on the emitted markup and final stylesheet strings.
 * Writes to Captured: nothing. It returns the trimmed markup.
 *
 * Why this exists: a framework leaves scope and instrumentation attributes all over the
 * markup, such as `data-astro-cid-*` and `data-f1rd-a7s-click`, dozens per element, that no css
 * selector ever matches. A human writing this page by hand would carry none of them. This drops
 * every `data-*` attribute whose name no selector in the shipped stylesheet references, so the
 * markup reads as the elements and hooks that actually style the component.
 *
 * Safety is by construction. An attribute no selector matches is inert for rendering, so
 * removing it cannot move a pixel. The rule is scoped to `data-*` names, so `aria-*` and every
 * functional attribute (id, class, href, src) are untouched, keeping semantics and
 * accessibility intact. The `data-snip-state` and `data-snip-pseudo` markers survive on their
 * own merit whenever a state or pseudo selector still names them, and are dropped only where
 * nothing does, with no special case. The referenced-name scan errs toward keeping, because a
 * stray `[` inside a value only adds a name to the kept set, and never removes one.
 *
 * The strip is textual and tag-scoped, matching each open tag and removing the dead attribute
 * inside it. Every other byte, the pretty-printer's indentation included, is preserved exactly,
 * and text content is never touched. The emitter double-quotes and escapes every attribute
 * value, so a quoted value delimits cleanly and a `>` inside one does not end the tag.
 */

/**
