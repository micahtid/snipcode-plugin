/**
 * convert/bem.ts: inline styles -> bem classes + css/scss
 *
 * Pipeline position: convert
 * Reads from Captured: clone, inline-styled
 * Writes to Captured: nothing. It deep-copies the clone, so the canonical clone is untouched.
 *
 * A format transform of the baked result.
 *
 * Why this exists: the bem-css and bem-scss formats want semantic
 * classes and a separate stylesheet instead of inline styles. This dedups
 * identical declaration sets into shared bem-named classes (block + block__element)
 * and emits either a flat css ruleset or a nested scss block. Like the other
 * emitters it works on a copy of the clone so all 7 formats stay derivable from
 * one capture. Ported from v1 css-to-bem.ts, the inline-to-class dedup, rewritten
 * and dropping the per-case branches.
 *
 * Beyond identical-set dedup, it factors a shared base class out of near-identical
 * rules. See factorBaseClasses. Rules sharing a large declaration subset are split
 * into one base class holding the intersection and per-member modifier classes
 * carrying only the differences, so the common declarations ship once. The split is
 * render-neutral by construction, using flat equal-specificity selectors plus a family
 * guard that never separates a shorthand from an overlapping longhand, and fully
 * deterministic, so the output stays byte-stable.
