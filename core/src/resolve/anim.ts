/**
 * resolve/anim.ts: @keyframes resolution

 * Pipeline position: resolve
 * Reads from Captured: bakedStyles, keyframes
 * Writes to Captured: keyframes, narrowed to referenced animations
 *
 * Travel-with-the-snip rule: a @keyframes block travels only if an animation in
 * the snip references it.
 *
 * Why this exists: animation/transition values are already baked onto elements,
 * but the @keyframes blocks they name live in stylesheets that do not travel.
 * This pairs the animation references in the baked styles with the captured
 * @keyframes and keeps only the ones actually used, so the emitted css carries
 * the animations the snip needs and nothing else. clean.ts re-checks this as
 * dead-code elimination. Here it is the resolve-phase pairing.
