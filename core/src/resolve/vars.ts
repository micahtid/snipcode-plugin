/**
 * resolve/vars.ts: css custom property resolution
 *
 * Pipeline position: resolve
 * Reads from Captured: root, clone, bakedStyles, variables
 * Writes to Captured: bakedStyles and clone (resolves var() refs and emits root vars)
 *
 * Variables travel with their definitions, or resolve to literals.
 *
 * Why this exists: earlier baking deliberately preserved authored var() references
 * on the baked elements. But a var() only renders if its definition survives into the
 * emitted snip. A definition survives when it lives on :root (re-emitted onto the
 * snip root here) or on an element inside the snip subtree (already inline on
 * that clone node). A definition on an ancestor *outside* the subtree does not
 * survive serialization, so its references are resolved to the computed literal
 * read from the live element, which already resolved them in-page.
 *
 * Single pass: every reference is decided in one sweep.
 * The only loop is computing the dependency closure of the root vars we keep,
 * that is resolving a definition's own var() deps, not a second orphan-recovery
 * pass over the output.

 * Resolves the var() references inside the synthesized <style>, meaning the state and pseudo
 * rules. A reference whose definition survives the snip is kept verbatim and renders
 * standalone: a subtree-scoped definition already travels on its clone node, and a
 * :root definition is marked needed so it is re-emitted on the root.
 *
 * A reference resolves in the standalone artifact through any of the ways a value
 * legitimately reaches it, so a declaration is kept whenever all of its references do:
 *  - a surviving definition: a subtree-baked value, a re-emitted ambient definition that is
 *    :root or foundation/`*`-scoped, or a custom property the synthesized rules define
 *    themselves, as in `:hover { --x: red; color: var(--x) }` or the tailwind `--tw-*` chain,
 *    resolved to a fixpoint so a chain of synthesized defs holds.
 *  - a registered @property initial-value: `var(--x)` yields the registered initial even
 *    when nothing sets it, and reconcile/properties.ts ships those registrations.
 *  - a fallback on the reference itself: `var(--x, black)` always produces a value.
 *
 * Only a reference that resolves through none of these is unreproducible: its state-time
 * value cannot be copied, because the live element's computed value is its RESTING value,
 * wrong for a `:hover { color: var(--accent-hover) }` whose accent only takes its hover
 * value while hovered. Only a forced-state measurement could get it, the deferred
 * follow-up. That declaration is dropped with a warning rather than baked to a wrong
 * color. Dropping is transitive through the fixpoint, so no dangling var() is ever emitted.
 *
 * @param captured - the synthesized <style> is rewritten in place, and warnings appended
 * @param subtreeDefs - custom-property names defined on a subtree element
 * @param ambientVars - the :root + foundation custom properties available to re-emit
 * @param neededAmbientVars - accumulates the ambient vars a kept reference depends on
